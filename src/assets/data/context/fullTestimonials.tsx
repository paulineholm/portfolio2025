export const fullTestimonials = `This is what my colleagues, teachers and managers have said about me:
"Pauline brings a lot of energy from the first time you meet her, she is not shy, but maybe an extroverted introvert, she is curious about a lot of things and that comes in handy when as a student developer you are faced with legacy systems, package updates that deprecates functions, weird functionality and behaviours :)
The good thing is that Pauline curiously takes on these challenges, investigate, tests and try to figure out the meaning of it all, she will still ask for help if she needs it, but do like to put the final piece of the puzzle into place herself.

On a more personal note, Pauline is outgoing and curious, great at talking to people and loves being social and having a good time on and off work. She loves to be creative and nerdy and also being a bit of a princess/diva at times (but who doesn't love that)."

"I worked with Pauline for around six months while she served as a student assistant and front-end developer in DFDS. During this time, Pauline consistently demonstrated her perseverance and dedication to her work.
One of Pauline's standout qualities is her proactive approach to involving her colleagues and keeping everyone updated on the latest trends. Her enthusiasm for staying current in the ever-evolving field of front-end development is truly commendable. Additionally, Pauline's linguistic skills are impressive, allowing her to communicate effectively and bridge gaps between team members from diverse backgrounds.
Pauline's contributions have been invaluable. I highly recommend Pauline for any role that requires a strong work ethic and a collaborative spirit."

"I had the pleasure of being Pauline’s manager as a Student Assistant on the Global Marketing team at Qufora. From the moment she joined our team, it was clear she was a true asset - being a newly formed role, she not only expertly filled it, but also shaped it with processes and ideas for the future. One of Pauline’s main tasks was to project manage the localization of the company website into Italian - in addition to her strong work ethic, Pauline stands out for her structured approach, being highly analytical and approaching the tasks with a clear and logical mindset. She consistently demonstrated a service-minded attitude to make the process as easy for her various stakeholders as possible, as well as her ability to work independently. She was always willing to lend a helping hand, and supported the team with a variety of tasks. On a personal level, Pauline is a joy to be around socially and her positive energy is motivating - as well as her passion and dedication to sustainability, and that she is always seeking to make a positive impact. Pauline is a valuable asset to any team and I am confident she will excel in any role she takes on. "

"Pauline har afsluttet webudvikleruddannelsen fra Roskilde Tekniske Skole ultimo marts 2022. De sidste 12 måneder af uddannelsen var det med undertegnede som primære underviser.

Når Pauline sætter sig et mål, forfølger hun det vedholdende også selvom læringskurven er stejl. Pauline arbejder systematisk, og har en god evne til at bryde den store, komplekse opgave ned i overskuelige delmål, uden at miste det overordnede mål af syne. Det er mit klare indtryk at dette gælder både for udvikleren og mennesket Pauline. 

Jeg kan give Pauline min varmeste anbefaling."

"I had the immense pleasure of working with Pauline at @SimpleVerySimple. Pauline was a pleasure to be around - selfdriving with a robust sense of quality and a solid work ethic. I can recommend Pauline highly and any employer should be lucky to hire her!"
