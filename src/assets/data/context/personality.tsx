RESEARCH INSIGHT
Assertive Commanders are the most likely personality type to consider themselves leaders.
STRENGTHS
Efficient: Commanders see inefficiency as something that pulls time and energy away from all their future goals, and will root out such behavior wherever they go.
Self-Confident: Commanders trust their abilities, make known their opinions, and believe in their capacities as leaders.
Strong-Willed: Commander personalities strive to achieve their goals, but nothing is as satisfying as rising to the challenge of each obstacle in their path to the finish line.
Charismatic: These qualities allow them to inspire and invigorate others, helping Commanders accomplish their often ambitious goals.
WEAKNESSES
Stubborn and Dominant: Confidence and willpower can go too far; Commanders may try to win every debate and push their vision (and others) too hard.
Impatient: They may misinterpret slower action from others as stupidity or disinterest.
Arrogant: They respect quick thoughts and firm convictions and may look down on those who can’t match them.
Poor Handling of Emotions: Their assertiveness and rationalism can distance them from emotional expression, making them sometimes dismissive of others’ feelings.
